# Quantum Path Planning for Delivery Vehicles  

> **Optimizing Vehicle Routing with Quantum Computing**  
This project explores how **quantum computing techniques** can revolutionize path planning for delivery vehicles. Our solution focuses on minimizing **travel time, fuel consumption, and operational costs**, while accounting for **traffic patterns, delivery time windows, and vehicle capacity constraints**.

## Project Overview  

Traditional vehicle routing algorithms often struggle as the number of vehicles, customers, and constraints grow.  
Our approach uses **Quantum Computing** (QUBO + Quantum Annealing) to solve this **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** more efficiently, aiming for **optimal or near-optimal delivery routes**.
